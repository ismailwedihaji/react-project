                 Body mass index (BMI) to determine how healthy you are.
                 For most adults, a BMI between 18.5 to 24.9 is the ideal BMI to have.

                 BMI is not a perfect measure, because it does not directly assess body fat.<br /><br />
                 Muscle and bone are denser than fat, so an athlete or muscular person may have a high BMI,
                 yet not have too much fat. But most people are not athletes,
                 and for most people, BMI is a very good gauge of their level of body fat.
