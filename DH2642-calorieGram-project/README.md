A project made with react for the course DH2642

## Description

CalorieGram is a website made for calculating fitness related information based on the users body weight, height, age and goal.

### so far:
So far we have worked based on the model presenter view to create a template for our project.
We are using fitness-calculator API to get all data we need for the calulations.
Some Styling has been made to the webpage but it is far from done.
Finally we have deployed the project using Firebase.
### To do in the future:
We have a model but it is still not utilized to its fullest potential and we intend to do so in the future.
More improvements to the styling shshall be made. Firebase will be also used when the model is in a more mature stage to save user data info.

### File structure
Since we are using the MVP model, we have a seperate folder for all three model view and presenter inside of src folder which has all the content of the project.
Other thann src we have a folder called public which inclueds more styling related files like style.css.
